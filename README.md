# Spritzy - Speed Reading App üöÄ

Spritzy is a modern web application designed to help users improve their reading speed and comprehension using the innovative **Spritz** reading technique.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Spritzy project locally:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/spritzy.git # Replace with actual repo URL
    cd spritzy
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Make sure you have Node.js (v18+) and npm installed.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

4.  **Configure AI Quiz (Optional):**
    - To use the AI-powered quiz generation feature, you need an API key from [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/).
    - Once the app is running, click the Settings icon (‚öôÔ∏è).
    - Navigate to the "Quiz" tab.
    - Paste your OpenRouter API key into the designated field.
    - **Note:** Your API key is stored _only_ in your browser's Local Storage and is never sent to any server other than OpenRouter's API endpoint during quiz generation/evaluation.
    - If you don't provide an API key, the quiz feature will fall back to generating mock questions.
